   ## Installation
   npm i to install relevant dependancies:
   - [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
   - [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
   
   ## Usage
   The node CLI prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
   
   The preview link provided above provides clear demonstration of use.
